In addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques.In this article, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.Contact: yvan.saeys@psb.ugent.beSupplementary information: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/supplementary_data/yvsae/fsreview},
